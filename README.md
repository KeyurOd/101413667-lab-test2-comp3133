# 101413667-lab-test2-comp3133

## Overview
This project is a lab test submission for COMP 3133, created by Keyur. It is a web application built with Angular that interacts with the [SpaceX API](https://api.spacexdata.com/v3/launches) to display a list of SpaceX missions. Users can filter missions by launch year, launch success, and landing success, and view detailed information about each mission.

### Features

- **Filters**: Allows filtering missions by:
  - Launch year (e.g., 2020)
  - Launch success (successful/failed)
  - Landing success (successful/failed)
- **Mission Details**: Shows detailed information about a selected mission, including flight number, rocket details, launch site, and links to Wikipedia and video.
- **Responsive Design**: Uses Angular Material for a clean, modern UI with card layouts, larger images, and hover effects.
- **Loading Spinner**: Displays a spinner while fetching data from the API.
- **Deployment**: Deployed on Vercel with automatic deployments from GitHub.
